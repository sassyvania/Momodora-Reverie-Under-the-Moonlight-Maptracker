## Installation

Unzip into poptracker's "packs" folder. That's it! On macOS you'll find the packs folder by right clicking on poptracker.app, clicking Show Package Contents, and navigating to Contents>MacOS>Packs.

## Notes
1) Only supports normal mode for now. I assume people playing Hard Mode (adds checks to perfect boss fights) don't really need a map tracker, but if people want that, I'll try to add it.

2) I don't think every seed is beatable, or if using the warp fragment in cat jail is included in the logic. But I had one where Eri traded a warp fragment for another warp fragment, somehow, so the rando can be a lil janky.

## To-Do

Hard Mode: Already kinda covered that

Version Mode: I need to find out if there's differences in the versions. I'm on 1.7 and none of the shops seem randomized. Might only work on 1.05b ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
